The Eye Tracker Test Rig is a robotic device that utilizes a set of artificial eyes and an artificial face to both manually and autonomously control a Surface Laptop via interface with a remote eye tracker. The rig features 3-axes of translational motion and 2-axes of rotational motion. The combination of these axes is intended to provide human-like motion for the artificial eyes and face. The rig is controlled via an Arduino Mega and features manual control via an Xbox controller.
